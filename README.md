With newly gained knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, features in the provided charity dataset are used to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Alphabet Soup’s business team provided a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

* EIN and NAME—Identification columns
* APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
* AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
* CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
* USE_CASE—Use case for funding
* ORGANIZATION—Organization type
* STATUS—Active status
* INCOME_AMT—Income classification
* SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
* ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
* IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

The ultimate goal is to utilize the newly created binary classifier to predict whether an organization that is applying for funding will be successful.
